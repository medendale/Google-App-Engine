## Google App Engine
<p>Google App Engine is a cloud computing platform as a service(pas) for developing and hosting web applications in Google-managed data centers. Applications are sandboxed and run across multiple servers. App Engine offers automatic scaling for web applicationsâ€”as the number of requests increases for an application, App Engine automatically allocates more resources for the web application to handle the additional demand.
